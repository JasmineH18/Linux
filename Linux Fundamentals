I've already practiced Linux commands in Tryhackme and HTB and will do this project on Ubuntu virtual machine from VirtualBox. 

Resources Used:

Environments Used:
-Ubuntu in Virtualbox

Started Ubuntu virtual machine and open a terminal. https://imgur.com/W8j1q1I

Interacting With the Filesystem

ls: Listing files in our current directory
Example: ls
Output: Desktop Documents Downloads 
Screenshot: https://imgur.com/rZ2zH5a

Tip: You can list the contents of a directory without having to navigate to it by using 'ls' and the name of the directory. I.e. ls Documents https://imgur.com/lQcTFrO

cd: Change directory
Example: cd Documents
Output: queen@Ubuntu:~/Documents$

cat: Concatenate, outputting the contents of a file
Example: cd Documents > ls > cat Hawkeye.txt
Output: You found me!
Screenshot: https://imgur.com/90pLSRq

Tip: You can use 'cat' to output the contents of a file within directories without having to navigate to it by using 'cat' and the name of the directory. I.e. cat /home/queen/Documents/Hawkeye.txt https://imgur.com/aSYnxNI

pwd: Print working directory, find out the full path to our current working directory
Example: pwd
Output: /home/queen/Documents

Searching for Files

find: Instead of using 'ls' and 'cd', we can use 'find' to automate things for us.
Example 1: find -name Marvel.txt
Output: ./Documents/Marvel.txt

Tip: If you don't remember the file name and 'find' can search file extension. I.e. find -name *.txt

Used THM VM
wc: Use "wc" to count the number of entries
Example: wc -l access.log
Output: 302

Used THM VM
grep: Allows us to search the contents of files for specific values that we are looking for.
Example: grep "3.18.18.132" access.log
Output: It'll search the entire contents of this file for any entries containing 3.18.18.132

Shell Operators

&: This operator allows you to run commands in the background of your terminal.
Example: cp applejuice.txt Documents & > cd Documents > ls
Output: [1] 4010 > [1]+ Done > applejuice.txt DC.txt Marvel.txt Thanos

&&:This operator allows you to combine multiple commands together in one line of your terminal.
Example: cd Documents && cat DC.txt
Output: Wonder Woman Superman Batman
Screenshot: https://imgur.com/7LdANqr

>: This operator is a redirector - meaning that we can take the output from a command and direct it elsewhere.
Example: 'echo sunny day > weather' > 'cat weather' > 'ls'
Output: sunny day

>>: This operator does the same function of the > operator but appends the output rather than replacing (meaning nothing is overwritten).
Example: 'echo rainy day >> weather' > 'cat weather' 
Output: sunny day rainy day
