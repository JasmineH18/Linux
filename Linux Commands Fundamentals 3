I've already practiced Linux commands in Tryhackme and HTB and will do this project on Ubuntu virtual machine from VirtualBox. 

Resources Used:
-https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

Environments Used:
-Ubuntu in Virtualbox

Started Ubuntu virtual machine and open a terminal. https://imgur.com/W8j1q1I

Terminal Text Editors

Nano editor make it easier to create and edit files instead of using 'echo' and operators '>' and '>>'.

Nano text editor commands
CTRL + G: Display help text
CTRL + O: Offer to write file ("Save as")
CTRL + K: Cut current line into cutbuffer
CTRL + T: Execute a function or an external command
CTRL + C: Display the position of the cursor 
CTRL + X: Close the current buffer, exit from nano
CTRL + R: Insert a file into current buffer, or into new buffer
CTRL + \: Replace a string or a regular expression
CTRL + U: Paste contents of cutbuffer
CTRL + J: Justify the current paragraph 
CTRL + /: Go to line and column number

Nano
Example: nano HarryPotter > Typed 'Daniel Radcliffe played the character Harry Potter.' > CTRL + O to save > Pressed Enter > CTRL + X to exit >  cat HarryPotter

Output: Daniel Radcliffe played the character Harry Potter.

VIM is an advanced text editor. 
Customisable: You can modify the keyboard shortcuts to be of your choosing.
Syntax Highlighting: This is useful if you are writing or maintaining code.
VIM works on all terminals.


General/Useful Utilities

wget: Allows us to download files from the web. You can download script, picture, program, etc.
Example: wget https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/latest/nano.html > ls
Output: nano.html

scp: Short for secure copy. This command lets you securely copying files. Allows you to transfer files between two computers using the SSH protocol to provide both authentication and encryption. Copy files/directories from your current system to a remote system or 
copy files/directories from a remote system to your current system 
Example: scp apples.txt queen@XXX.XXX.X.XX:/home/queen/Apples2.txt
Output: It should show the renamed file Apples2.txt to the location you provided

http.server: Python3 provides a module called 'HTTPServer'. This module turns your computer into a web server that you can use to serve your own files, where they can then be downloaded by another computing using commands such as 'curl' and 'wget'. 
Example: python3 -m http.server > Opened new tab: wget http://XXX.X.X.XX:8000/apples.txt

Output: Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/)
XX.X.X.XX - - [22/Feb/2024 18:24:37] "Get /apples.txt HTTP/1.1" 200 -

Connecting to XXX.X.X.XX:8000... connected.
HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK
Length: 22 [text/plain]
Saving to: 'apples.txt.1'

Processes 101

Processes are the programs that are running on your machine. They are managed by the kernel, where each process will have an ID associated with it, also known as its PID. The PID increments for the order In which the process starts. I.e. the 60th process will have a PID of 60.

Viewing Processes

ps: This command will show the list of running processes

ps aux: This command will let you see the processes run by other users and those that don't run from a session.

top: This command will give you real-time statistics about the processes running on your system instead of a one-time view. These statistics will refresh every 10 seconds, but will also refresh when you use the arrow keys to browse the various rows.

Managing Processes

kill: You can kill a command usig 'kill' and the associated PID that we wish to kill.

Below are some of the signals that we can send to a process when it is killed:
SIGTERM - Kill the process, but allow it to do some cleanup tasks beforehand
SIGKILL - Kill the process - doesn't do any cleanup after the fact
SIGSTOP - Stop/suspend a process
 
Example 1: kill 1709
Example 2: sigterm 1709
Example 3: sigkill 1709
Example 4: sigstop 1709

Getting Processes/Services to Start on Boot

systemctl: This command allows us to interact with the systemd process/daemon.

There are four options you can use with systemctl:
Start
Stop
Enable
Disable

Example 1: systemctl start apache2
Example 2: systemctl stop apache2
Example 3: systemctl enable apache2
Example 4: systemctl disable apache2

An Introduction to Backgrounding and Foregrounding in Linux

Processes can run in two states: In the background and in the foreground. 

Foreground Example: echo "Hello World"
Output: Hello World

Background Example: echo "Hello World" &
Output: [1] 3571
Hello World

Foregrounding a process

fg: This command can be used to bring the background process back into use on the terminal.
Example: root@Ubuntu:/$ /var/opt# fg
